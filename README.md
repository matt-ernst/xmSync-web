# Welcome to xmSync!

xmSync is an open-source project that bridges the gap between SiriusXM’s distinctive music curation and modern streaming platforms like Spotify. Inspired by the unique variety found on stations such as John Mayer Radio, xmSync empowers users to bring that same diversity to their Spotify queue—even if they can’t access SiriusXM directly.
What is xmSync?

## xmSync is a web and script-based application that:

* Automatically adds currently playing and newly discovered tracks from a SiriusXM station to your Spotify queue.
* Can be run via a Python script in a separate repository, from a web interface, or hosted locally.
* Is fully open source, allowing anyone to contribute or customize the project.

## Why xmSync?

The project was inspired by the realization that SiriusXM’s John Mayer Radio station offered a richer, more interesting mix than Spotify’s built-in radio. xmSync was created to provide everyone with access to that level of music variety, regardless of their SiriusXM subscription status.
Key Features

* Automatic Queueing: Seamlessly syncs SiriusXM tracks to your Spotify queue in real time.
* Flexible Deployment: Use xmSync as a web app, run it locally, or execute the Python script—whatever fits your workflow.
* Open Source: Freely available for customization, contribution, and self-hosting.
* Future-Ready: Plans to support other platforms like Apple Music and YouTube Music.

## Technical Highlights

* Python for backend logic and scripting
* Flask for the web application framework
* JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for a user-friendly interface

## The Road Ahead

xmSync aims to become a universal bridge between the best of curated radio and the convenience of streaming. Future updates will expand support to additional platforms, ensuring that more listeners can enjoy a richer, more varied music experience—no matter where or how they listen.
